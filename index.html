      <h3>Listening and Speaking</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          The teaching content of this lesson is selected from the "14th
          Five-Year Plan" vocational education national planning textbook
          published by Higher Education Press, the listening and speaking part
          of Unit 1 "Travel" of "English 2 Basic Module". Students are
          required to understand hotel reservation dialogues, record key
          information for hotel room reservations, introduce tourist
          attractions, and recommend suitable travel routes based on customer
          needs.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          The theme of this unit is travel, which is closely related to
          students' lives. Students are generally very interested in different
          customs and practices, and the vast majority of students have travel
          experiences both domestically and abroad. Students can briefly
          introduce attractions in English, but their ability to describe
          attractions in detail needs improvement, and they cannot accurately
          introduce the characteristics of travel destinations to others. In
          terms of preparing for travel topics, such as booking rooms,
          students lack experience. Therefore, teachers design teaching
          activities to guide students in learning travel-related vocabulary
          and sentences, learning dialogues to introduce attraction
          information to others, practicing substitutions, and then using the
          learned travel-related language knowledge to introduce attractions
          to "tourists".
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          1.Students can understand dialogues about hotel room reservations and
          obtain key information.<br />
          2.Students can combine model sentences and given key information to
          complete descriptions of tourist destinations.<br />
          3.Students can recommend reasonable travel products based on customer
          travel needs.<br />
          4.Students can understand and describe the general situation of some
          famous domestic and international tourist destinations.<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Key and Difficult Points</h4>
        <p>
          Teaching Focus: Accurately describing the general situation of
          travel destinations.<br />
          Teaching Difficulties: Recommending reasonable travel products based
          on customer needs.

        <h4>Teaching Procedure</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 1: Warming Up </strong><br />
          <u>1. Think and Match</u> <br />
          Handling Teaching Activity 1 can be divided into two steps: * <br />
          (1) Brainstorm: Activate vocabulary reserves. Students speak out
          about travel destinations and famous attractions they have visited.
          The teacher can provide appropriate pictures as prompts to activate
          student thinking.<br />
          (2) Provide four pictures and country names, ask students to observe
          carefully, and match the text with the pictures based on existing
          knowledge. Ask students "Which country is this?" and provide
          feedback on their responses.<br />
          <u>2. Tick and Discuss</u> <br />
          Handling Teaching Activity 2 can be divided into three steps:<br />
          (1) Students view pictures and familiarize themselves with related
          vocabulary, laying the groundwork for language knowledge. <br />
          (2) Ask peers what preparations they make before traveling.<br />
          The teacher can provide key sentences:<br />
          What will you prepare before traveling?<br />
          I often---/ I will---<br />
          What about you?<br />
          Sample answer: <br />
          A: The summer holiday is coming. What do you have to prepare before
          traveling? <br />
          B: I often search for local scenic spots with my smartphone. What
          about you?<br />
          A: I will book tickets and hotel rooms online.<br />
          (3) Group activities: Discuss and collect what preparations people
          need to make before traveling, and then make group presentations.
          (Design intent: This section aims to stimulate students' interest in
          this unit through brainstorming, peer dialogue, group discussions,
          etc., while mastering relevant vocabulary and expressions, laying
          the language and background knowledge foundation for listening
          activities.) <br />
          <strong>Step 2: Listening </strong> <br />
          <u>1.Listen and Tick</u> <br />
          Handling Teaching Activity 3. Students read the options before
          listening to familiarize themselves with them. Then they listen to
          the recording and make choices. The teacher checks and provides
          feedback after listening. <br />
          <u>2. Listen and Decide Handling</u> <br />
          Teaching Activity 4. Students first read the options and make
          preliminary judgments. Then they listen to the recording, grasp
          keywords, and select the correct option. The teacher checks and
          provides feedback after listening. <br />
          <u>3. Listen and Complete Handling</u> <br />
          Teaching Activity 5 can be divided into three steps: <br />
          (1) Students browse the information to be filled in the reservation
          card (guest name, gender, room type, and personal preferences).
          <br />
          (2) Listen to the recording and fill in the blanks based on the
          given prompt words: First Name, Gender, Types of room, The guest’s
          preferences.<br />
          (3) After the listening ends, the teacher checks and verifies the
          answers, presents the listening text, and briefly analyzes the key
          information. (Design intent: This section aims to train students'
          ability to grasp key information while helping them understand the
          information needed to book a room before traveling and the key
          sentence patterns that can be used.) <br />
          <strong>Step 3: Speaking </strong><br />
          <u>1. Listen, Read, and Underline</u><br />
          Handling Teaching Activity 6 can be divided into three steps:
          <br />(1) The teacher introduces the dialogue background, students
          listen to the recording, imitate the pronunciation and intonation,
          and underline the sentences related to discussing travel
          destinations. The teacher provides answers. Then, two students are
          invited to demonstrate the dialogue and receive feedback. <br />(2)
          The teacher briefly explains the following key words and phrases:<br />
          guide, on-the-way, coach, province, marvelous, <br />dense,
          vegetation, wild, scenic spot, be famous for,<br />
          ethnic culture.<br />
          Key sentence patterns:<br />
          We are now in the … In front of us is …<br />What is the most famous
          scenic spot here? <br />Shangri-La is famous for … <br />It’s really
          worth visiting. <br />Could you tell us more about … ? <br />I can’t
          wait to get there. <br />(3) Students practice replacing key
          information provided by the teacher using vocabulary and sentence
          patterns for introducing attractions (expansion activity).<br />
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Destination</th>
            <th>Senic Spot</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Shanghai</th>
            <td>Disneyland<br>
              Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower<br>
              Nanjing Road Shopping Street<br>
              Yu Garden<br>
              The Bund</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Harbin</th>
            <td>Harbin Ice World<br>
              The Sun Island<br>
              Harbin Central Street<br>
              Yabuli Ski Resort</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>New York</th>
            <td>Statue of Liberty<br>
              Empire State Building<br>
              The central park<br>
              The Fifth Avenu</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <u>2.Imitate and Practice:</u><br>
        Deal with Activity 7. It can be divided into three steps:<br>
        (1) With the guidance of the teacher, students first review the sentences related to discussing travel
        destinations in Activity 6.<br>
        (2) Discuss two pictures with the teacher.<br>
        Where is it?<br>
        What can you see from the picture?<br>
        Do you know any other information about this place?<br>
        (3) With the help of the communication framework from Activity 6 and the discussion results from the previous
        step, students practice replacement exercises. Practice with peers and present to the whole class. The teacher
        checks and provides feedback.<br>
        Answer:<br>
        A: We are now in Jiuzhaigou Valley.<br>
        B: Marvelous! Look at the trees and the lakes!<br>
        A: That’s right. Jiuzhaigou Valley is a very popular tourist destination in China.<br>
        B: What is the most famous scenic spot here?<br>
        A: A great many! It is famous for the natural green lakes, dense forests, and …<br>
        B: Sounds great! So we’ll be able to see many beautiful places.<br>
        A: You certainly will. It’s really worth visiting.<br>
        B: Could you tell us more about Jiuzhaigou Valley?<br>
        A: Yes. There’s a giant panda national park, too.<br>
        B: Wow! I can’t wait to visit it.<br>

        <u>3.Role Play:</u><br>
        Deal with Activity 8, which can be divided into four steps:<br>
        (1) Create a scenario: Imagine you are a staff member of a travel agency. Please carefully read the travel
        wishes and destination information of the tourists and select suitable travel products for them.<br>
        (2) Brainstorm: Guide students to list possible sentences based on the text provided in Activity 6 (making
        suggestions, describing attractions, etc.). The teacher guides students to design a dialogue framework for
        recommending travel products based on the text and brainstorming results.<br>
        Staff: Can I help you, Sir?<br>
        Guest: Sure, I am … (brief introduction about themselves) I’m interested…and I like…. I’m looking for a product
        … (to travel around during the coming holidays./to experience a different culture/have a relax…)<br>
        Staff: Why not take a look at…<br>
        Guest: I’m wondering what attractions are included in the tour?<br>
        Staff: A great many. Like …/ you can enjoy…<br>
        Guest: Sounds great! I love …<br>

        (3) Students and peers arrange dialogues based on the provided prompts and practice.<br>
        (4) The teacher selects some students to perform and then guides students to peer evaluate and provide feedback.
        <br>(Correct pronunciation, correct use of intonation, correct grammar, appropriate sentence expression.)<br>
        (Design intent: This segment, through reading and imitating sample dialogues, practicing key sentences, and
        creating scenarios such as recommending travel products, aims to equip students with basic language expressions
        about travel. Based on this foundation, language knowledge and speaking skills are transferred to practical
        contexts according to students' language proficiency, fostering students' language interaction and thinking
        abilities in professional contexts, and enhancing their ability to solve practical problems.)<br>

        <strong>Step 4: Conclusion</strong><br>

        Guide students to review vocabulary and sentence patterns for introducing tourist attractions.<br>
        Summarize what was learned in the accompanying micro-lessons for the listening and speaking sections of the
        textbook.<br>

        <strong>Step 5: Homework</strong><br>

        1.Please find information and write a dialogue recommending a one-day tour of Beijing for the tourist David,
        based on his preferences:<br>
        David: An American student<br>

      <h3>Reading and Writing</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>The teaching content of this lesson is selected from the "Reading and Writing" section of Unit 1 of the
          textbook. It requires students to read articles, become familiar with and master the stylistic and linguistic
          characteristics of biographical articles introducing individuals' life stories; through observation, analysis,
          and comparison, learn the narrative methods of stories about individuals, clarify the context of articles, and
          exercise the ability to extract and summarize textual information. By using a timeline to become familiar with
          the life of Xu Xiake and combining it with his life experiences and outstanding contributions, students can
          perceive the great charm of historical figures, inspire themselves to set lofty aspirations, and dare to make
          efforts for them.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>After two previous lessons, students have already mastered vocabulary and sentences related to travel. They
          can converse with peers and introduce information about scenic spots to them. By researching materials for
          homework, students have learned about the life stories and major achievements of some world-famous travel
          adventurers. However, most of this information exists in fragmented form, incomplete, and disjointed. Most
          students have not read biographical articles in English about individuals' life stories and are not familiar
          with the characteristics and linguistic features of this type of genre.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          1.Students can understand biographical articles about individuals' life stories and, through observation,
          analysis, and comparison, understand the writing characteristics of biographical articles introducing
          individuals' life stories.<br>

          2.Learn to use the skimming reading strategy and use a timeline to extract key information from texts
          introducing Xu Xiake's life experiences.<br>

          3.Students can extract information from texts introducing individuals and complete promotional posters.<br>

          4.Understand the roles of Xu Xiake and Marco Polo in promoting human civilization. By understanding the travel
          experiences, indomitable will, and contributions to future generations of two travel adventurers from
          different countries, enhance awareness of the importance of cross-cultural exchanges between different
          countries.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Key and Difficult Points</h4>
        <p>Teaching Focus: Becoming familiar with the writing characteristics of biographical articles about
          individuals' life stories, using the skimming reading strategy to extract information from texts introducing
          individuals, and completing promotional posters.<br>

          Teaching Difficulties: Combining the requirements of the poster, extracting main information from texts
          introducing Xu Xiake and Marco Polo to complete the poster.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Teaching Procedure</h4>
        <p>

          (2) Practice question and answer exercises with peers based on the questions and answers in Activity 13.<br>
          *You can also follow the introduction methods of Xu Xiake and Marco Polo. Introduce your favorite traveler's
          life, major achievements, and works based on the information searched before class.<br>
          (3) The teacher asks some students to imitate the introduction methods in the textbook to introduce Marco Polo
          or other travelers.<br>
          (Design Intent: This activity aims to help students practice reading strategies, such as scanning to extract
          central ideas, summarizing the main theme of the article; skimming: using a timeline to extract key
          information, organizing Xu Xiake's life; students think and discuss Xu Xiake's key success factors from the
          text to exercise thinking skills; briefly compare Xu Xiake with Marco Polo or other travelers to expand
          cultural perspectives.)<br>

          <strong>Step 4: Writing</strong><br>
          <u>1. Read and complete:</u><br>
          Deal with textbook Activity 13, which can be divided into four steps:<br>
          (1) Students reread the article and Activity 13 content, reviewing the main information about Xu Xiake and
          Marco Polo.<br>
          *(2) Guide students in group discussions and answer the following questions:<br>
          - Who was Xu Xiake/Marco Polo?<br>
          - At what age did he set out on his first trip?<br>

      <h3>Language Practice & Vocabulary</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          The main content of this lesson comes from the Language Practice section of Unit 1 in the textbook, which is
          divided into two parts: Grammar and Vocabulary. The focus is on studying the usage of the past simple tense,
          the changes in irregular verbs in the past tense, and the usage of key vocabulary in this unit's reading
          materials. Students will summarize the basic usage of the past simple tense by observing example sentences,
          identifying, completing sentences, and rewriting short passages. They will practice using the past simple
          tense to improve their language proficiency. By applying phrases and words in specific contexts, students will
          reinforce the language points of this unit and achieve the goal of real application.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>After studying English in middle school, students have a certain understanding of the past simple tense, but
          it may not be thorough or systematic. Most students can understand the usage of the past simple tense but may
          struggle to accurately use it to describe events. While students are familiar with the changes in regular verb
          past tense, their memorization of irregular verb past tense may not be accurate. Therefore, teachers need to
          guide students in summarizing, practicing, and memorizing irregular verb past tense to deepen their memory and
          ultimately achieve the goal of accurately using the past simple tense to describe events.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>

          1.Students can summarize the basic usage of the past simple tense by observing example sentences.<br>

          2.With the guidance of the teacher, students can recall the past tense of commonly used irregular verbs<br>

          3.Through exercises like completing sentences, students can accurately apply the past simple tense in specific
          contexts.<br>

          4.Review key vocabulary and phrases such as "all sorts of," "due to," "set off," "give up," "pass through,"
          etc. Practice using these phrases and words correctly to consolidate the language points of this unit.<br>

          5.By learning and applying grammar knowledge, students can develop good learning habits and improve their
          language proficiency.

      <h3>Culture Understanding &Group Work</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          The main content of this lesson is Culture Understanding and Group Work in Unit 1. The Culture Understanding
          activity is an explanatory text that introduces the difference between tourists and travelers. The article has
          a clear structure and contains a lot of comparative introductions. It comprehensively introduces what
          constitutes tourists and travelers, covering their identity differences, travel purposes, and different
          attitudes towards travel. The Group Work requires students to integrate language knowledge learned in this
          unit to create travel plans based on the travel preferences of tourists and the information provided in the
          textbook, exercising their ability to perceive differences in thinking.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          Through the learning in the previous five lessons, students have gained a deep understanding of topics such as
          travel, introduction to attractions, and the life stories of travel explorers. They have mastered vocabulary
          and sentence structures related to travel. They can understand dialogues about booking hotel rooms, introduce
          corresponding attractions based on prompts, read biographies of characters to understand their writing style
          and language characteristics. However, they still cannot synthesize the language knowledge learned in this
          unit to solve specific problems related to travel in professional scenarios.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 1: Warming-up</strong><br>
          Handling page nine of the textbook "Culture Understanding" can be divided into three steps:<br>
          1. Students read the title and briefly discuss the differences between travelers and tourists, combining the
          dialogues about travel and the introduction of Xu Xiake in this unit.<br>
          2. Read the text and fill in the table below by summarizing the differences between travelers and tourists
          through comparative analysis.<br>
          <table>
            <caption>Differences between a traveler and a tourist</caption>
            <tr><th></th><th>Traveler</th><th>Tourist</th></tr>
            <tr><th>Aims for travel</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><th>Activities during travel</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
          </table>
          3. Based on the information in the table, discuss with your group according to your own experiences and
          preferences: Would you choose to be a tourist or a traveler? Why?<br>
          (Design intent: Through reading the text, gain a deeper understanding of the different travel attitudes and
          purposes between travelers and tourists. Perceive the different needs of individuals during travel, summarize
          the differences between tourists and travelers. Analyze personal travel preferences and attitudes towards
          travel based on one's own situation.)<br>

          <strong>Step 2: Group Work</strong><br>
          1. Scenario: Suppose you are a staff member of an international travel agency. Three students from different
          countries want to visit Beijing. Please design a five-day Beijing tour plan for them based on their respective
          preferences.<br>
          (Design intent: Create a scenario. Students solve real problems in English in a real professional setting to
          enhance their workplace language communication skills.)<br>
          2. Handling textbook Group Work activity 1 can be divided into two steps:<br>
          - Read the personal introductions of three foreign students, identify the travel preferences of the three
          individuals, and summarize key information to fill in the Travel Preference Form.<br>
          <table>
            <tr><th>Name</th><td width="60%"></td></tr>
            <tr><th>Nationality</th><td></td></tr>
            <tr><th>Interested in</th><td></td></tr>
          </table>
          - Review the answers as a class, and the teacher provides feedback and comments.<br>
          (Design intent: Summarize the basic information and travel preferences of three foreign students, exercise the
          ability to summarize while preparing for the design of the travel plan.)<br>
          3. Handling textbook Group Work activity 2 can be divided into two steps:<br>
          - Understand the information provided in the form.<br>
          - Carefully observe the pictures and match them with the types of attractions. The teacher calls out students'
          names for checking and provides feedback.<br>
          (Design intent: Understand the information about attractions to prepare for designing the travel plan.)<br>
          4. Handling textbook Group Work activity 3 can be divided into four steps:<br>
          - Group discussion: Select one tourist based on the travel preference form and the information about
          attractions to create a travel plan for them.<br>
          - Discuss in groups and select attractions for the tourist based on their travel preferences, briefly
          explaining the reasons.<br>
          - Fill out the travel plan form for activity 3.<br>
          - Each group takes turns presenting, and the whole class evaluates them.<br>
          (Design intent: Consolidate the knowledge learned in this unit, apply it comprehensively to complete real
          tasks, and assess learning outcomes. Group discussions develop students' teamwork and innovation
          abilities.)<br>

          <strong>Step 3: Self-assessment</strong><br>
          1. Look at the word cloud and review vocabulary related to travel. Check your mastery of words and phrases
          from this unit.<br>
          2. Based on what you've learned in this unit, fill out the self-assessment form on page fourteen of the
          textbook. Self-assess your understanding of the learning content in this unit, identify any shortcomings, and
          reflect on them.<br>
          (Design intent: Use the word cloud to check your understanding of vocabulary and phrases from this unit.
          Through self-assessment, identify any shortcomings, strengthen self-directed learning awareness, develop good
          study habits, and promote sustainable development of language learning and learning abilities.)<br>
