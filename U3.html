        <h3>Listening and Speaking</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            The content of this lesson is selected from the “Fourteenth
            Five-Year Plan” vocational education national planning textbook
            published by the Higher Education Press, “Basic English Module 2,”
            focusing on Unit 3's listening and speaking section. It requires
            students to be familiar with the names of internship positions and
            locations, understand related terminology, and apply learned
            sentence patterns to discuss their internship experiences.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            The target students for this lesson are first-year students at
            vocational schools. After a semester of study, these students have
            acquired some basic English knowledge, gradually mastered vocational
            English learning methods, developed some reading skills, and formed
            good learning habits, thus gradually increasing their interest in
            learning. However, there are still some students with less interest,
            who seldom practice speaking, and whose learning capabilities need
            improvement. Therefore, teachers can use rich visual content to
            present activities and exercises in this lesson to activate
            students’ existing knowledge for teaching.

            as:<br />
            - agreement, assistant, challenge, guest, colleagues, training,
            definition, description, etc.<br />
            3. Students should be able to discuss and communicate about
            internship situations in English based on different contexts:<br />

            How is it going with…?<br />
            I’ve got a problem. Could you please…?
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            The content for this lesson is taken from Unit 1's reading and
            writing section of the textbook, which requires students to
            understand the specific content related to work projects. This
            allows students to have a detailed understanding of the projects,
            and enables them to compare and analyze key information, refine
            these details, organize internship projects, and practice their
            reading comprehension and key information extraction skills.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            After the previous two lessons, students are now able to discuss
            different work scenarios, use common sentence patterns to address
            and resolve issues encountered during internships and training, and
            possess some ability to summarize and report on their internships.
          </p>

            1. Students should be able to understand the specific arrangements
            of internships and training, and have a detailed understanding of
            the projects.<br />
            2. Students should be able to accurately use important vocabulary
            and phrases during their internships and training, such as teamwork,
            creating resumes, and develop active skills to complete internship
            briefings.<br />
            3. Students should be able to organize the text structure and
            clarify the article's context through subtitles and mind maps,
            training their ability to refine and summarize text information.<br />
            4. Students should be able to develop good learning habits and
            improve their language learning and application skills through

        <h3>Language Practice & Vocabulary</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            The main content of this lesson includes the "Language Practice" and
            "Vocabulary" sections, focusing on the past continuous tense and the
            key vocabulary of this unit. The past continuous tense is a
            grammatical topic students frequently encounter. Understanding this
            tense accurately and being able to apply it proficiently can
            facilitate learning of future tenses. The key vocabulary is derived
            from the listening and reading materials of this unit, and teachers
            can further explain and organize exercises and tests to reinforce
            the learned content.

        <div>
          <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            Students, having studied English during their middle school years,
            have some understanding of English grammatical phenomena, but not in
            depth. Some students find memorizing vocabulary and grammar
            challenging, leading to a fear of these topics. Helping students
            overcome this fear and boosting their confidence in learning English
            is an important task for teachers. Additionally, teachers should
            encourage active learning in the English classroom, create engaging
            scenarios, ask questions frequently, and promote extensive practice
            in vocabulary and grammar.

        <div>
          <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
          <p>
            1. Master the basic usage of the past continuous tense and be able
            to apply it accurately.<br />
            2. Accurately use key vocabulary in specific contexts, such as: was
            waiting, was brushing, were reading, were running, was working,
            etc.<br />
            3. Through the study and practical application of grammatical
            knowledge, students should develop good study habits and improve
            their language application skills.<br />
            4. By studying the past continuous tense in English, students should
            develop good study habits and enhance their language application
            skills.

        <h3>Culture Understanding &Group Work</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            This lesson integrates the "Culture Understanding" and "Group Work"
            sections of the textbook. The "Culture Understanding" section
            introduces the Australian Vocational and Technical Colleges,
            expanding knowledge on foreign vocational education and appreciating
            its importance in the educational systems abroad. The "Group Work"
            section guides students to complete real tasks during their
            internships and training, testing their learning outcomes, further
            consolidating the language knowledge about internships introduced in
            this unit, and fostering teamwork and innovation skills. By
            completing an internship briefing design, students learn to respect
            the cultural differences between Western and Eastern corporate
            cultures in practice, understand cultural diversity, and strengthen
            cultural confidence.

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            After studying a unit, students have mastered important sentences
            for communication during internships and training, can conduct
            simple exchanges about their internships, and report on their
            experiences. Students are able to use vocabulary and sentence
            patterns to discuss and resolve issues encountered during
            internships to summarize a training briefing. However, as students
            receive less training in internship-related writing on regular days,
            they face certain difficulties.
