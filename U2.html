      <h3>Listening and Speaking</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          The content of this lesson is drawn from the "14th Five-Year Plan"
          vocational education national planning textbook published by Higher
          Education Press, "English 2 Basic Module," focusing on Unit 2's
          listening and speaking section. It requires students to be able to
          communicate about medical consultations, provide relevant advice on
          health issues, and devise appropriate strategies for health
          consultations based on real situations.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          This lesson's target audience is first-year students at vocational
          high schools. After nine years of compulsory education, they have a
          basic reserve of English knowledge. However, there is a significant
          disparity: some students are very interested in learning and can
          communicate fluently in English; others are less interested and
          hesitant to speak. Therefore, teachers should design their teaching
          activities appropriately, starting from easy to difficult, from
          simple to complex, transitioning from mechanical imitation to
          substitution exercises, and then to practical language use,
          gradually laying the groundwork to minimize potential difficulties
          and frustrations. After initial English lessons, students can use
          common terms like headache, fever, toothache, and stomachache to
          describe health conditions, and they understand some sentence
          patterns for inquiring about health and giving reasonable advice,
          but further learning is still needed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          Students should be able to understand dialogues about health issues
          and hospital visits, and extract key information.<br />
          Students should be able to use sentence patterns related to
          different lifestyles to discuss maintaining health and enhance
          awareness of health issues.<br />
          Students should be able to provide suitable consultation advice and
          medical opinions based on key information, fostering a caring
          attitude towards others.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Key and Difficult Points</h4>
        <p>
          Key points: Being able to communicate based on different health
          issues and provide suitable advice.<br />

          difficult Points: Proficient use of sentence patterns for consulting
          about health issues and giving medical opinions.

        <h4>Teaching Procedure</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 1: Warming Up</strong><br />

          <u>*1. Act & Guess.</u><br />

          Activate vocabulary: Students act out physical discomfort and other
          students guess and state the related English words. Teachers may
          provide pictures as prompts to activate thinking.<br />
          Address textbook activity 1. Attempt to use gestures for "allergy"
          and "under pressure" and have students say them in Chinese.<br />
          <u>2. Think and describe.</u><br />
          Handle textbook activity 2, which can be divided into two
          steps:<br />
          (1) Present a scenario: You meet a friend, notice his discomfort,
          inquire and offer advice.<br>
          (2) The teacher presents information on
          common symptoms and sentence patterns for inquiries and advice.
          Students use key information and sentence patterns to engage in
          simple scenario dialogues, cultivating a caring nature.

            <th>Information Element</th>
            <th>Common phrases and sentence patterns</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Signs of unwellness</th>
            <td> feel tired<br>
              feel worried<br>
              have a sour throat<br>
              lose your temper</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>You may ask</th>
            <td> -You don`t look well. What`s wrong with you?<br>
              -I…<br>
              -You should…</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Your suggestion</th>
            <td> see a doctor<br>
              drink plenty of water<br>
              have a good rest<br>
              ask others for help</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        (Design intent: This step aims to activate students' vocabulary
        about common symptoms of discomfort and familiarize them with
        inquiry and advice expressions under guided sentence patterns,
        preparing them for the next listening activity.)<br>
        <strong>Step 2: Listening</strong><br>
        <u>1.Listen and tick.</u><br>
        Address textbook activity 3. Before listening, students identify
        scenes in option images and predict the listening content. Then,
        listen to the recording, make selections based on the options, and
        grasp and judge the listening material overall. After listening, the
        teacher checks and provides feedback.<br>
        <u>2. Listen and decide.</u><br>
        Handle textbook activity 4. Students first read the options for
        preliminary judgment. Then, listen to the recording, identify key
        words, judge correctness, and correct misinformation. After
        listening, the teacher checks and provides feedback.<br>
        <u>3. Listen and complete.</u><br>
        Handle textbook activity 5 in two steps: <br>
        (1) Students first preview the medical record form, determine the
        information needed (symptoms, duration, causes, and suggestions),
        then listen to the recording, note relevant information, and
        complete the form. After listening, the teacher checks and verifies
        answers, presents the listening text, and briefly analyzes key
        information.<br>
        (2) Extension activity: The teacher adds the following extension
        questions, and students raise their hands to answer:<br>
        Can you give some suggestion to Jack? (He can sleep early and take a
        lot of rest.)<br>
        What can you do for Jack if he asks for help? (I can finish his work
        together with him.)<br>
        (Design intent: This step aims to train students to predict the
        listening content based on available information, gather and
        summarize key information during listening, focusing on developing
        students' language communication and interactive skills, and
        learning to care for others.)<br>
        Here's the translation of the text from Chinese to English:<br>

        <strong>Step 3: Speaking</strong><br>

        <u>1. Listen, read, and underline.</u><br>
        (1) Handle textbook activity 6. The teacher introduces the
        background of the dialogue, students listen to the
        recording, read along, and underline sentences related to medical
        consultations. Then, two students perform the
        dialogue.<br>
        (2) Extension activity: The teacher briefly explains the following
        key phrases and sentence structures. On
        this basis, students focus on practicing these sentence
        patterns:<br>
        - appointment number, have a sore throat, have a terrible cough,
        have a bad cold, take medicine, have a good
        rest, heavy food, do more exercises, avoid, recover<br>
        Examples of key phrases:<br>
        - Here is my appointment number.<br>
        - What’s wrong with you?<br>
        - How long have you been like this?<br>
        - I’m afraid you have…<br>
        - What can I do about it?<br>
        - What else should I pay attention to?<br>
        - When can I recover from it?<br>
        - It will take…<br>
        <u>2. Imitate and practice.</u><br>
        Handle textbook activity 7, which can be divided into two steps:<br>
        (1) Preliminary activity: Students compete in groups, listing
        reasons and suggestions based on symptoms. Each
        correct answer earns one point.<br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>stomachache</th>
            <th>fever</th>
            <th>toothache</th>
            <th>under pressure</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> don`t look well<br>
              look pale<br>
              feel terrible<br>
              drink hot water<br>
              keep warm</td>
            <td> feel cold<br>
              headache<br>
              muscle pain<br>
              drink plenty water<br>
              take a good rest</td>
            <td> have a decayed tooth<br>
              can`t bite anything<br>
              eat too much sweet<br>
              brush teeth carefully<br>
              see the dentist<br>
              eat less sweet</td>
            <td> feel upset<br>
              a bad temper<br>
              be tired of work<br>
              don`t feel like talking<br>
              ask partners for help<br>
              sleep early<br>
              find and enjoy happiness everyday<br>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        (2) In pairs, students cooperate with a peer to discuss symptoms,
        causes, and medical advice using the
        information provided by pictures and the vocabulary from activity 6,
        practicing dialogue imitation with keyword
        substitution. The teacher provides feedback.<br>

        Reference Answers:<br>
        - Patient: Good morning, Sir. Here is my appointment number.<br>
        - Doctor: Thank you. So, what’s wrong with you?<br>
        - Patient: I have a toothache.<br>
        - Doctor: I see. How long have you been like this?<br>
        - Patient: Since last Friday.<br>
        - Doctor: Please open your mouth. Hmmm, I’m afraid you have a
        decayed tooth.<br>
        - Patient: What can I do about it? I feel really bad.<br>
        - Doctor: Well, take this medicine one tablet three times a day and
        brush your teeth twice a day.<br>
        - Patient: What else should I pay attention to?<br>
        - Doctor: You’d better eat less sweet food.<br>
        - Patient: Thank you. When can I recover from it?<br>
        - Doctor: Well, it’ll take about one week.<br>

        <u>3. Role play.</u><br>
        (1) Handle textbook activity 8. Assume you are a staff member at the
        school health office, responding to
        students' health inquiries.<br>

        Examples of student descriptions and advice:<br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Student 1</th>
            <th>Student 2</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>- ^be overweight<br>
              - ^like to eat hamburgers, popcorn, and heavy food<br>
              - ^like to drink colas</td>
            <td>- ^have a sore neck<br>
              - ^have dry eyes<br>
              - ^eyes glued to the mobile phone / laptop<br>
              - ^sit without moving</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>- ^control weight<br>
              - ^be physically active<br>
              - ^avoid junk food<br>
              - ^eat more healthy food</td>
            <td>- ^protect your eyes and neck<br>
              - ^control the overuse of electrical devices<br>
              - ^do more physical exercises</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        Reference Answers:<br>
        (At the School Health Center)<br>
        - Staff: Welcome to the School Health Center. What can I do for
        you?<br>
        - Student: Well, I had a school physical examination last week, and
        the health report said I am overweight. What
        can I do about it? I feel really terrible.<br>
        - Staff: What do you usually have for dinner?<br>
        - Student: I like to eat hamburgers, popcorn, and heavy food. And I
        like to drink colas.<br>
        - Staff: That might be the reason. Well, if you want to control
        weight, you’d better avoid junk food. What’s
        more, do more exercise and be physically active.<br>
        - Student: Thanks for your advice. I’ll follow them. Bye.<br>
        - Staff: You are welcome. Wish you could lose your weight and become
        healthy. Bye-bye.<br>

        (2) Extension activity: Continue to provide health advice to other
        students based on the following
        information.<br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Student 1</th>

        </table>
        (Design intent: This section aims to help students master basic
        language expressions for medical consultations
        through reading model sentences, practicing sentence substitution,
        etc. Based on students' language proficiency,
        this knowledge and oral expression skills are transferred to real
        contexts, fostering their language interaction
        ability and cognitive skills.)<br>
        <strong>Step 4: Conclusion</strong><br>
        Guide students to discuss the following two questions, combining
        with the listening and speaking
        micro-course from Unit 2 of the textbook, to summarize what they've
        learned:<br>
        - How can we get information about personal health?<br>
        - What else can we do to stay healthy?<br>
        - Guide students to discuss the following<br>
        two questions, combining with the listening and speaking

        - How can we get information about personal health?<br>
        - What else can we do to stay healthy?<br>
        <strong>Step 5: Homework</strong><br>
        1. Design a health survey questionnaire and invite classmates,
        teachers, and family members to participate
        in their own health assessment.<br>
        2. Extension homework: Record a “Health Advisor” video.<br>
        (1) In teams of 2 to 3 students, select a health issue based on the
        survey results, and create a video to
        demonstrate the correct solution and exercise methods, then upload
        it to the learning platform or class
        group.<br>
        (2) Conduct a class vote to select two of the best “Health Advisor”
        team projects.<br>

        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          The teaching content for this lesson is taken from the reading and
          writing section of Unit 2 of the textbook.
          Students are expected to understand short texts about modern health
          issues and extract key information, become
          familiar with and master the key points of writing online replies,
          and be able to complete replies to posts in
          the health column of a website as instructed.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          After the first two lessons, students are now able to communicate
          about various health issues and provide
          reasonable advice using common sentence patterns. Meanwhile,
          students have a basic understanding of the
          importance of maintaining health and need to further extract more
          information about the importance of exercise
          in maintaining physical and mental health from the texts.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          Students should be able to understand articles about health issues
          and the importance of exercise, and extract
          key information for reasoning and judgment.<br>
          Students should be able to complete a mind map about health issues
          and reply to posts in the health column of
          a website as prompted.<br>
          Students should be able to engage in self-evaluation and post-lesson
          reflections to develop good learning
          habits and improve their language learning and application
          skills.<br>

      <div>
        <h4>Key and Difficult Points</h4>
        <p>
          Key Point: Ability to familiarize with and apply skimming and
          intensive reading techniques to understand the
          content of articles, mastering the vocabulary and sentence
          structures commonly used to describe modern health
          issues.<br>
          Difficulty: Ability to extract key information from reading passages
          and use relevant vocabulary and sentence
          structures to complete replies to posts in the health column of a
          website.

      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Teaching Procedure</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Before class:</strong><br>
          Extension Activity: Students complete a questionnaire about daily
          exercise and living habits distributed by
          the teacher before class. The questionnaire includes:<br>
          How long can you take a walk every day?<br>
          Do you wash your clothes by hand?<br>
          How many hours are your eyes glued to your phone every day?<br>
          <strong>During class:</strong><br>
          <strong>Step 1: Preview</strong><br>

          (1) Students discuss the benefits of exercise for physical and
          mental health based on their own experiences,
          laying the groundwork for subsequent reading activities.<br>
          (2) Extension Activity: The teacher invites students to share the
          results of the questionnaire. Students
          discuss and consider how to engage in positive exercise.<br>
          (Design Intent: This section starts by introducing the results of
          health check-ups, reviewing the content from
          the previous two lessons, and assessing the students' learning
          outcomes. The goal is to guide everyone to
          focus on their own health and that of people around them. Students
          familiarize themselves with key vocabulary
          through discussions on the benefits of exercise, thereby deepening
          their understanding of the importance of
          regular exercise for maintaining health.)<br>

        students design and create a mind map.<br>
        <img src="./assests/U2_RW1.jpg" alt="Mind Map" style="display: block; margin:auto; width: 60%;">
        (Design intent of this activity is to focus on cultivating students'
        ability to quickly find key words during
        reading, closely read to compare, analyze, and extract key
        information, thus interpreting the content of the
        text through marking key information, finding supporting sentences,
        comparing and analyzing detailed
        information, and summarizing main features.)<br>
        <strong>Step 4: Post-reading</strong><br>
        <u>1.Read and Decide.</u><br>
        Handle textbook activity 12. Students extract detailed information
        from the text, mark key words, expand their
        understanding of sentence details, and judge the accuracy of the
        information and correct it.<br>
        (1)Many people are burning off more (less) energy because their life
        is busier (easier) than before.<br>
        (2)Modern health problems may include being overweight, moving
        around less, and having too much work
        pressure.<br>
        (3)Exercise is one of the best ways to keep people away from modern
        health problems.
        <u>2.Read and Reorder.</u><br>
        Handle textbook activity 13, which can be divided into two
        steps:<br>
        *(1)Preliminary Activity: Students find key words that connect the
        context based on five sentences about health
        from the text.<br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Sentence</th>
            <th>Key Information</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>First, exercise can reduce people`s chances to develop heart
              disease or cancer.（A）</td>
            <td>first</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>What is more, exercise can reduce people`s risk of suffering
              from stress and depression.（B）</td>
            <td>what is more</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Exercise can help people lead a healthier and happier
              life（C）</td>
            <td>healthier and happier life</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>All in all, exercise would be the best medicines ever
              invented to improve people`s life quality.（D）</td>
            <td>all in all</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Second, exercise can boost people`s self-respect, mood,
              sleep quality and energy.（E）</td>
            <td>second</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        (2)Students clarify the logical relationship between sentences based
        on the key words and arrange the sentences
        in order:<br>
        C => A => E => B => D <br>
        (The design intent here is to improve reasoning and understanding of
        logical relationships of sentence details
        by getting detailed information from the text and making judgments,
        building on the previous activity.)<br>
        <strong>Step 5: Writing</strong><br>
        Read and Reorder.<br>
        Handle textbook activity 14. Students read posts from the health
        column on a website and reply based on the
        health issues mentioned in the posts, which can be divided into two
        steps:<br>
        (1) Quickly read the post to find the health issues of the
        inquirer.<br>
        (2) Read the reply posts, deduce the content of the replies by
        identifying key information, and give reasonable
        advice.<br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Key Information</th>
            <th>Possible Answer</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>be physically active</td>
            <td>1) do more exercises</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>be related with being overweight</td>
            <td>2) eat healthily for keeping fit</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Don;t ne ashamed of yourself</td>
            <td>3) enjoy yourself in taking some exercise</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>your energy and sleep quality</td>
            <td>4) boost your mood</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        (3) Student groups share their writing, with teachers and students
        providing evaluations.<br>
        Writing Evaluation Criteria:<br>
        Is the use of relevant vocabulary and sentence structures for giving
        advice correct?<br>
        Can the advice provided answer the inquirer's questions?<br>
        Is the reply clear and logical?<br>
        Is the grammar correctly used?<br>
        Are the words spelled correctly?<br>
        (The design intent of this step is a writing activity, where the
        teacher guides students to replicate replies
        using the language knowledge they have learned, based on repeatedly
        studying the reading materials, and
        mastering the basic format of replying to posts on websites.)<br>
        <strong>Step 6: Conclusion.</strong><br>
        The teacher guides students to combine the micro-lessons of the
        reading and writing sections of this unit to
        summarize what has been learned.

        <strong>Step 7: Homework. Health Advisor</strong><br>
        Students design a daily health plan for the inquirer, helping them
        recover health from aspects of diet and
        living habits, and share it with classmates.<br>

        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          The main content of this lesson includes the Language Practice and
          Vocabulary sections of the textbook. Through observation and
          identification, students will master the sentence patterns
          "subject + linking verb + complement",
          "subject + verb + object + adverbial" and the basic usage of the
          "There be" structure. The unit's key vocabulary is derived from the
          listening and reading materials of this unit. Students will master
          the key vocabulary of the unit by using phrases and words in
          specific contexts. Teachers can further explain and organize student
          practices and assessments to consolidate the learned content.

        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          After last semester's English study, students have mastered the
          basic tenses and have a certain understanding of some English
          grammatical phenomena. However, they are not clear about the
          composition and usage of the "subject + linking verb + complement"
          and "subject + verb + object + adverbial" sentence patterns. They
          have a basic understanding of the "There be" structure, but their
          grasp of the subject-verb agreement principle is not solid. Teachers
          can help students construct knowledge structures and understand
          their internal connections through example sentences and sentence
          patterns, thus enabling them to more accurately recognize and use
          them. For vocabulary learning, teachers should pay attention to
          creating contexts to help students master the application of
          vocabulary.

        <h4>Teaching Procedure</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 1: Warming-up</strong> <br>
          1. Brainstorm: Students recall the related knowledge of the
          "subject + verb + object", "subject + linking verb + complement"
          sentence patterns, and the "There be" structure, leading to example
          sentences of the "subject + verb + object + adverbial" pattern.<br>
          *2. Students watch the grammar micro-lesson video of Unit 2,
          recalling key knowledge from the previous Brainstorm activity.<br>
          (Design Intent: Help students list the related knowledge of the
          "subject + linking verb + complement",
          "subject + verb + object + adverbial", and "There be" structures,
          preparing for the systematic consolidation of this fragmented
          knowledge.)<br>
          <strong>Step 2: Presentation</strong> <br>
          1. Read and classify.<br>
          Handle textbook activity 15 in five steps:<br>

          "subject + verb + object + adverbial", and "There be" structures in
          six given sentences.<br>
          (2) Through observation, comparison, and analysis, students identify
          and classify the sentence patterns, and the teacher summarizes the
          composition and usage of the three patterns.<br>
          (3) Students understand the meanings of sentences and classify them
          according to sentence structure, filling in a table. The teacher
          checks the answers and explains.<br>
          (4) The teacher explains the subject-verb agreement principle of the
          "there be" structure using example sentences:<br>
          There were (be) two meetings yesterday.<br>
          There is (be) a pen, two books, and many pencils on the desk.<br>
          There are (be) two books, a pen, and many pencils on the desk.<br>
          (5) Based on understanding the three sentence patterns, students
          each create three sentences.<br>
          (Design Intent: This activity requires students to master and judge
          the "subject + linking verb + complement",
          "subject + verb + object + adverbial", and "There be" sentence
          structures through observation, comparative analysis, and
          summarization, and to understand the pragmatic functions these
          sentences carry based on context.)<br>
          <strong>Step 3: Practice</strong> <br>
          1. Read and reorder.<br>
          Handle textbook activity 16, where students observe the components
          of given sentences and combine them according to the
          "subject + linking verb + complement",
          "subject + verb + object + adverbial", and "There be" sentence
          structures.<br>
          2. Read and complete. <br>
          Handle textbook activity 17 in two steps:<br>
          (1) Students observe the given options, assess the sentence
          structure, and understand their meanings in context, with teachers
          posing questions based on student levels.<br>
          (2) Students select the appropriate sentences to fill in a dialogue,
          judging logical consistency with the context.<br>
          (Design Intent: This section requires students to focus on using and
          consolidating the "subject + linking verb + complement",
          "subject + verb + object + adverbial", and "There be" structures in
          practice, enhancing their comprehensive language application skills
          and developing summarization habits.)<br>

          1.Choose and complete.<br>
          Handle textbook activity 18 in two steps:<br>
          (1) Together, teacher and students review phrases related to
          consulting and responding to health issues from this unit, focusing
          on the phrases given in textbook activity 18.<br>
          (2) Students choose the appropriate phrases and complete a text
          using their correct forms.<br>
          2. Read and complete.<br>
          Handle textbook activity 19 in two steps:<br>
          (1) Together, teacher and students review vocabulary related to
          consulting and responding to health issues from this unit.<br>
          (2) Students choose the appropriate forms of the given vocabulary to
          complete a text.<br>
          (Design Intent: This activity provides students with specific
          contexts to practice using phrases and words, consolidating the
          language points of the unit and achieving real-world
          application.)<br>
          <strong>Step 6: Homework</strong> <br>

(Design Intent: Through discussion, students further understand the depth of TCM and its major differences from Western medical systems, connecting current events to introduce the advantages of TCM in treating COVID-19 sequelae, enhancing national pride.)<br>
<strong>Step 2: Practice</strong><br>
<strong>Group work:</strong><br>
1. Groups discuss the daily use of electronic devices and various consequences, such as:<br>
How long do you spend on your electronic products every day?<br>
How do you feel after long-time use of your phone?<br>
2. Handling the Group Work Activity 1's chart and Activity 2's text segment in two parts:<br>
(1) Students observe the information displayed in the chart, including the names of countries and numerical data, and guess the meaning of "Fatigue" based on the "Score" they are familiar with in the title; this is followed by group discussions and exchanges.<br>
(2) Students read the text segment and complete the information in reference to the chart.<br>
3. Handling the Group Work Activity 1's chart and Activity 2's text segment in two steps:<br>
(1) Students observe the information in the chart showing country names and numbers, and guess the meanings of "Annual" and "per day" in the title; discussions in groups follow and then sharing.<br>
(2) Students read the text segment and fill in the missing information by referring to the chart.<br>
4. Combine given charts and passages to discuss potential health issues and reasonable suggestions, providing at least two answers per question.<br>
(Design Rationale: This activity requires students to use the language knowledge mastered in the unit to complete simulation tasks within specific contexts, guiding students to understand the health issues caused by changes in modern lifestyles through chart information, enhancing their awareness of health and exercise, and developing their problem-solving abilities.)<br>
<strong>Step 3: Conclusion</strong> <br>
Self-assessment:<br>
1. Review vocabulary clouds to check mastery of unit words and phrases.<br>
2. Fill out a table to evaluate your own performance based on the unit's learning.<br>
(Design Rationale: Using vocabulary clouds, students can assess their mastery of unit vocabulary and phrases, identify areas for improvement, strengthen autonomous learning awareness, and develop learning plans tailored to their characteristics while engaging in self-assessment, summary, and reflection, promoting sustainable development of language learning and abilities.)<br>
<strong>Step 4: Homework</strong><br>
Design a "Health & Fitness---Something we should know" wall newspaper and submit it to the school's public account.<br>
