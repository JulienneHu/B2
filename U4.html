      <h3>Listening and Speaking</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>The teaching content of this lesson is selected from Unit 4 of the "English 2 Basic Module" section, part of
          the national vocational education planning textbook for the "14th Five-Year Plan," published by Higher
          Education Press. The lesson requires students to understand information related to the theme of volunteer
          work, communicate about the topic of volunteer recruitment, apply for volunteer work based on their personal
          circumstances, and develop a deeper understanding of the social responsibility associated with volunteer work.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>The target audience for this lesson is first-year students in secondary vocational schools. After studying
          English in Basic Module 1, they have acquired some foundational English knowledge, but there is a significant
          polarization in their abilities. Some students are very interested in learning and can communicate relatively
          fluently in English, while others lack interest, have a fear of difficulties, and are reluctant to speak.
          Therefore, the teacher should follow the principles of progressing from easy to difficult, from simple to
          complex, from mechanical imitation to substitution exercises, and then to language practice, gradually paving
          the way to minimize the difficulties and frustrations students may encounter.<br>
          After the preliminary study of "Basic Module 1" English, students have already learned sentence patterns and
          vocabulary related to personal information, personal experiences, and school life. They have some
          understanding of common expressions for introducing themselves and personal experiences but are not familiar
          with the differences in usage scenarios and the applicability and flexibility in different contexts.
          Particularly regarding the theme of volunteer work, they need in-depth learning and practice to match
          information in communication.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          Students will be able to understand dialogues introducing basic information about volunteers and related work
          and extract key information.<br>
          Students will be able to describe personal basic information, personal experiences, and abilities based on the
          given information.<br>
          Students will be able to use appropriate methods to communicate information about volunteer recruitment in
          different scenarios.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Key and Difficult Points</h4>
        <p>
          Key Teaching Points: Phrases and sentence patterns for describing personal basic information, experiences, and
          abilities in volunteer activities.<br>
          Difficult Teaching Points: Fluently using key sentence patterns and vocabulary to apply for volunteer work.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h4>Teaching Procedure</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 1: Warming Up</strong><br>

          <u>1. Preparation Activity: Lead-in</u><br>
          (1)Activating Vocabulary:** The teacher shows students a series of pictures related to volunteers (e.g.,
          Olympic volunteers, daily garbage sorting) and asks:<br>
          "Who are they? What are they doing?" <br>
          This prompts students to recall vocabulary related to volunteers and work scenarios, such as: volunteer, serve
          visitors, help sort the garbage.<br>
          "What kind of people are they?" <br>
          This encourages students to recall vocabulary related to personality traits and skills relevant to the theme,
          such as:<br>
          Personality: patient, kind, active, careful, confident, cooperative.<br>
          Skill: be good at dancing/sports/drawing; love art/music; speak English well.<br>

          <u>2. Think and Match</u><br>
          Process Activity 1 from the textbook. The teacher presents pictures and phrases related to volunteer
          activities from Material 1, and students match them.<br>

          <u>3. Think and Talk</u><br>
          (1)Activity 2 from the textbook:** Students discuss in groups to choose suitable volunteer activities based on
          their talents and specialties.<br>
          (2)Students imitate Activity 2 from the textbook, using common job titles from the Brainstorm, and practice
          conversation in a chain within the group.<br>
          Example:<br>
          - A: "What kind of volunteer work do you want to do?"<br>
          - B: "I’m good at ______________, I like ______________. So I want to be a volunteer for
          ________________."<br>
          (Design Intent: This stage aims to activate students' vocabulary related to self-introduction and types of
          volunteer work, and familiarize them with relevant expressions with sentence prompts, preparing for the next
          listening activity.)<br>

          <strong>Step 2: Listening</strong><br>

          <u>1. Listen and Choose</u><br>
          Process Activity 3 from the textbook. Students read the options before listening, predict the listening
          content, then listen to the recording, and choose based on keywords (e.g., park). After listening, the teacher
          checks and provides feedback.<br>

          <u>2. Listen and Tick</u><br>
          Process Activity 4 from the textbook. Students read the options first to make preliminary judgments, then
          listen to the recording, grasp keywords, determine correctness, and correct any errors. After listening, the
          teacher checks and provides feedback.<br>

          <u>3. Listen and Complete</u><br>
          Process Activity 5 in two steps:<br>
          (1)Students first browse the diary, using reading strategies to judge the information needed for each blank
          (e.g., time, profession, number, etc.).<br>
          (2)Listen to the recording and complete Lily's diary. After the listening ends, the teacher checks and
          verifies the answers, presents the listening text, and briefly analyzes the key information.<br>
          (3)Extension Activity: The teacher supplements the following extension questions, and students raise their
          hands to answer:<br>
          - What did Lily do last weekend?<br>
          - How did Lily feel about the activity?<br>
          - What problem did Lily meet?<br>
          (Design Intent: This stage aims to train students to predict listening content based on existing information
          and extract and summarize key information during listening, focusing on developing students' information
          extraction skills.)<br>

          <strong>Step 3: Speaking</strong><br>

          <u>1. Listen, Read, and Underline</u><br>
          (1)Activity 6 from the textbook: The teacher introduces the dialogue background, students listen to the
          recording, read along, and underline sentences that inquire about personal information. Two students perform
          the dialogue.<br>
          (2)Extension Activity: The teacher briefly explains the following key phrases and sentence patterns. Based on
          this, students practice the key sentence patterns:<br>
          Phrases related to volunteer activities:<br>
          do some cleaning in a community, collect plastic bottles, visit the elderly in the nursing home, be a teacher
          in rural areas, plant trees on a hill, protect animals, pick up rubbish, sort the garbage.<br>
          Sentence patterns for introducing oneself:<br>
          - I’d like to be a volunteer at a rural elementary school in Gansu Province.<br>
          - I major in Elementary Education at a university.<br>
          - I hope to help the students in rural areas and gain some teaching experience.<br>
          - I helped to collect some books and sent them to elementary schools.<br>
          - I’m also good at information technology.<br>
          - I can teach them English and computer science.<br>


          <u>2. Imitate and Practice</u><br>
          Process Activity 7 from the textbook.<br>
          (1)Preparation Activity: Students list words related to volunteer work in a group competition format from the
          following four aspects:<br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Personality</th>
            <th>Skills</th>
            <th>Jobs</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              Outgoing<br>
              Careful<br>
              Clever<br>
              Patient<br>
              Nice<br>
              Friendly<br>
              Creative<br>
              Warm-hearted<br>
              energetic<br>
              ...
            </td>
            <td>
              be good at<br>
              dancing/sports/drawing;<br>
              love<br>
              art/music/animals;<br>
              speak English well;<br>
              have some medical knowledge;<br>
              ...
            </td>
            <td>
              teacher><br>
              student<br>
              nurse<br>
              salesperson<br>
              engineer<br>
              cook<br>
              scientist<br>
              writer<br>
              reporter<br>
              pilot<br>
              ...
            </td>
          </tr>

        </table>
        (2)Students pair up and, using the information from the pictures and vocabulary in the table, practice imitative
        dialogues by replacing keywords according to the communication framework of Activity 6. The teacher provides
        feedback.<br>
        Reference Answer:<br>
        - A: "Good morning, Sir. I’d like to be a volunteer for garbage sorting guidance."<br>
        - B: "Amazing! Please introduce yourself."<br>
        - A: "I am a student at Beijing vocational school and I major in pre-school education. I’m careful and good at
        communication."<br>
        - B: "Have you done any volunteer work before?"<br>
        - A: "Yes. I helped to sort garbage in my school and I hope to make our city cleaner."<br>
        - B: "Thank you, Sally. We’ll consider your application and inform you of the result soon!"<br>

        <u>3. Role Play</u><br>
        (1)Activity 8 from the textbook: Process in two steps:<br>
        - Students read the material, and the teacher guides them to determine the main information, including the
        following aspects:<br>
        - You will -- responsibility<br>
        - You need to be -- requirement<br>
        - You can --- achievement<br>
        - Based on the given scenario, students practice dialogues in pairs, reproducing the questions and
        self-introduction sentence patterns from Activity 6. The dialogues can be done in two rounds, with roles
        exchanged in the second round.<br>
        (2)Extension Activity: Simulate a volunteer recruitment fair.<br>
        Requirements: Each group drafts a recruitment theme based on activities from Materials 6, 7, and 8. The whole
        class is divided into several groups, each group (3-6 people) assigns 2 interviewers and several job
        applicants.<br>
        Process: Each group’s interviewers take turns introducing recruitment requirements. Job applicants independently
        choose a theme to apply for and communicate with the interviewers. Interviewers issue appointment letters
        directly based on actual situations. Finally, the groups report on the volunteer recruitment situation.<br>
        (Design Intent: This stage, through activities like reading key sentence patterns, imitative dialogues by
        replacing keywords, and expansion activities, enables students to master the basic language expressions for
        applying for volunteer work. On this basis, expansion activities transfer language knowledge and speaking skills
        to real-life contexts, cultivating students' language interaction skills and thinking abilities.)<br>

        <strong>Step 4: Conclusion</strong><br>

        Guide students to discuss the elements of applying for volunteer work and summarize what was learned in the
        lesson:<br>
        - purpose, personality, skill, experience.<br>

        <strong>Step 5: Homework</strong><br>

        1. Summarize the sentence patterns for expressing purpose, personality, skills, and experience.<br>
        2. Search online for “Volunteer Beijing” activities and write a dialogue for applying for a volunteer job based
        on real activity requirements. Upload the recording to the learning sharing platform.<br>

        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          The teaching content of this lesson is selected from the reading and writing section of Unit 4 in the
          textbook. Students are required to understand articles about volunteer recruitment, identify the logical
          structure of the text, learn about the cultural background of International Volunteer Day, understand the
          significance of volunteer work, and complete a short essay on applying for a volunteer position.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          After the first two lessons, students have a preliminary understanding of volunteer activities and can answer
          basic questions related to applying for volunteer work, including introducing personal traits, skills, and
          experiences, and stating reasons for applying as a volunteer. However, students still lack the ability to
          handle real-life scenarios and adapt flexibly, and they need a deeper understanding of the value and
          significance of volunteer work.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>

          1. Extra Activity: search background information about volunteer recruitment at the Forbidden City<br>
          <u>During Class:</u><br>
          <strong>Step 1: Preview</strong><br>
          1. Introduce the lesson topic through a report on pre-class surveys.<br>
          <strong>Step 2: Pre-reading</strong><br>
          1. Think and Discuss: Process Activity 9 from the textbook.<br>
          (1) Students discuss the benefits of volunteer activities based on their own or pre-class survey findings,
          preparing for the upcoming reading activity.<br>
          (2) Extension Activity: The teacher presents statistical data from the pre-class questionnaire, and students
          discuss and answer the question:<br>
          "Why do these people like to be volunteers?"<br>
          (Design Intent: This stage aims to reflect the current societal understanding of volunteer activities through
          real data, deepening the understanding of the significance of volunteerism, and facilitating the transfer of
          meaning for the reading content related to Forbidden City volunteers and Volunteer Day, forming a value
          understanding.)<br>
          <strong>Step 3: While-reading</strong><br>
          <u>1. Read and Underline:</u><br>

          Process Activity 10, divided into two steps:<br>
          (1) Review reading strategies: Determine the theme and paragraph main idea based on article images, titles,
          topic sentences, and paragraph opening sentences.<br>
          (2) Students quickly skim the short text, look for theme keywords, and choose appropriate titles.<br>
          <u>Read and Match:</u><br>
          (1) Process Activity 11. Students reread the paragraphs, infer the paragraph themes based on keywords and
          sentences in the text, and match them with the topic sentences.<br>

        </table>
        (2) Writing Preparation Activity: Students organize the writing structure based on the topic sentences in the
        above table.<br>

        <u>3. Read and Decide: </u><br>
        Process Activity 12.<br>

        Students read the text carefully, find sentences similar to those below, compare similarities and differences,
        and judge whether the following statements are correct:<br>
        1) The Palace Museum in Beijing has a history of less than 600 years.<br>
        Original text: "With a history of over 600 years, the Palace Museum in Beijing receives over 19 million visitors
        from home and abroad." (Information is inconsistent)<br>
        2)The Palace Museum receives over 19 million visitors from abroad every year.<br>
        Original text: "With a history of over 600 years, the Palace Museum in Beijing receives over 19 million visitors
        from home and abroad." (Information is incomplete)<br>
        3)Volunteers need to be skilled in communication and organization.<br>
        "We need people who…, people who are skilled in communication and organization." (Information is
        generalized)<br>
        4)Applicants who cannot speak English well will not be accepted.<br>
        Same as above.<br>
        5)The volunteer work includes meeting visitors at the airport.<br>
        (No corresponding information)<br>
        (Design Intent: This stage uses reading strategies to infer key information from the text, summarize the text
        structure, and deduce the basic writing structure, laying the foundation for the subsequent writing stage. It
        also focuses on cultivating students' ability to quickly find keywords, compare, analyze, and extract key
        information during reading to interpret the text's connotation.)<br>

        <strong>Step 4: Post-reading</strong><br>
        <u>1.Read and Discuss:</u><br>
        Process Activity 13.<br>
        (1) The teacher assigns tasks, and students search for all information about the needs of Forbidden City
        volunteers during reading and categorize it.<br>
        Purpose: to offer better service to visitors, are willing to serve the public.<br>
        Age: 20–60.<br>
        Personality: helpful, patient, responsible, healthy.<br>
        Skill: speaking Chinese or English, communication, and organization skills, loving and having a good knowledge
        of Chinese history and culture.<br>
        Work: introducing the architecture and exhibits to visitors, guiding visitors during busy seasons, answering

      <h3>Language Practice & Vocabulary</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          The main content of this lesson focuses on the "Language Practice" and "Vocabulary" sections of the textbook,
          specifically targeting exclamatory sentences and key vocabulary from this unit. The key vocabulary comes from
          the unit’s listening and reading materials. The teacher can further explain, organize practice, and test the
          students to reinforce the learned content.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          After studying English in junior high school, students have a basic understanding of the use of exclamatory
          sentences, but this understanding is not deep enough, and the flexibility and accuracy of language use need to
          be improved. Therefore, how to help students consolidate the use of exclamatory sentences and apply them in
          actual language environments is a key issue to consider and address. For vocabulary learning, the teacher
          should create scenarios to help students master the use of vocabulary.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          1. Students will be able to master the basic usage of exclamatory sentences and accurately use them to express
          strong emotions.<br>
          2. Students will be able to accurately use key vocabulary such as "major in," "home and abroad," "act as,"
          "look forward to," "be skilled in," etc., in specific contexts.<br>
          3. Students will develop good learning habits during the learning process and improve their language
          application skills.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Key and Difficult Points</h4>
        <p>
          Key Teaching Points: Mastering the basic forms and distinguishing the usage of exclamatory sentences with
          different introductory words.<br>
          Difficult Teaching Points: Accurately using exclamatory sentences to express strong emotions in specific
          contexts.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Teaching Procedure</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 1: Warming-up</strong><br>
          1. Brainstorming: Students recall relevant knowledge about exclamatory sentences, and the teacher writes key
          points
          on the board.<br>
          (Design intention: Helps students list knowledge related to exclamatory sentences, preparing them for
          systematic
          organization of these fragmentary pieces of knowledge.)<br>
          2. Language Practice---Grammar:<br>
          Students read the example sentences in the Grammar section and, through group discussion, summarize the basic
          structures of two types of exclamatory sentences. Based on the students’ discussion, the teacher provides the
          specific basic structures of exclamatory sentences.<br>
          Basic Structures of Exclamatory Sentences:<br>
          Introduced by "What":<br>
          What + a/an + (adjective) + singular countable noun + subject + predicate!<br>
          What + (adjective) + plural countable noun or uncountable noun + subject + predicate!<br>
          Introduced by "How":<br>
          How + adjective (adverb) (+ subject + predicate)!<br>
          How + subject + predicate!<br>
          (Design intention: Through existing language information, encourage students' thinking ability to summarize
          basic structures, enhancing their awareness of autonomous learning.)<br>
          3. Classify Example Sentences According to Basic Structures:<br>
          Examples:<br>
          How great! — How + adjective (adverb)<br>
          How hard the workers are working! — How + adjective (adverb) + subject + predicate<br>
          What an unforgettable experience it is! — What + a/an + (adjective) + singular countable noun + subject +
          predicate<br>
          What friendly volunteers they are! — What + (adjective) + plural countable noun or uncountable noun + subject
          + predicate<br>
          (Design intention: Through complete grammatical structures, cultivate students' ability to analyze problems,
          promoting the development of thinking quality.)<br>
          <strong>Step 2: Presentation</strong><br>
          <u>1. Read and Match:</u><br>
          Process activity 15 from the textbook, which can be divided into two steps:<br>
          (1) Students distinguish the basic differences between "What" and "How" by reviewing the questions and
          identifying
          the key words in the sentences.<br>
          (2) Students match sentences based on the content in two columns to complete the exclamatory sentences.<br>
          Reference Answers and Keywords:<br>
          (C) 1) What terrible weather we’ve had these days!<br>
          (E) 2) How important the meeting is!<br>
          (B) 3) What an amazing history the museum has!<br>
          (A) 4) How helpful the volunteers are!<br>
          (D) 5) What a busy day the volunteers had in the park!<br>
          (Design intention: This activity requires students to observe, compare, analyze, summarize, and judge, deeply
          internalizing the structure of exclamatory sentences.)<br>

          <u>2. Choose and Complete</u><br>
          Process activity 16 from the textbook. Students determine the key words in the sentences by reviewing the
          questions
          and match "What" and "How" based on the word types of the key words. Reinforce What + noun and How +
          adjective/adverb.<br>
          Reference Answers and Keywords:<br>
          How quickly the boy is writing!<br>
          What an interesting story it is!<br>
          What responsible teachers they are!<br>
          How beautiful the building is!<br>
          How delicious the cakes are!<br>
          How slowly Tom runs!<br>
          <strong>Step 3: Practice</strong><br>
          <u>1. Look and Describe:</u><br>
          Process activity 17 from the textbook, which can be divided into two steps:<br>
          (1) Students create sentences based on pictures and prompt words, transferring knowledge through practice.<br>
          (2) Extended Activity: Teachers can organize students to pick out photos with strong emotions from school
          life, provide
          appropriate vocabulary as language support for the photos, and bring in different levels of vocabulary based
          on
          students’ language foundation. Students create sentences based on the photos.<br>
          Example Photos and Sentences:<br>
          Photo: Lihua wins an award in an activity, paired with vocabulary (proud/excellent)<br>
          Sentences: How proud Lihua is! What an excellent student Lihua is!<br>
          (Design intention: This stage requires students and teachers to provide real-life photos with strong emotions
          from
          school life, enhancing students’ ability to use language in real contexts, facilitating knowledge
          internalization.)<br>
          <strong>Step 4: Practice</strong><br>
          <u>1. Choose and Complete:</u><br>
          Process activity 18 from the textbook, which can be divided into two steps:<br>
          (1) Teachers and students review the relevant vocabulary of this unit, focusing on the combinations
          practiced in activity 17.<br>
          (2) Students choose appropriate phrases and use their suitable forms to complete the passage.<br>
          <u>2. Read and Complete:</u><br>
          Process activity 19 from the textbook, which can be divided into two steps:<br>
          (1) Students read the material, identify the text type as a job application letter, and understand the
          theme of the letter. They choose suitable words and use their appropriate forms to complete the
          application letter. The whole class checks the answers together.<br>
          (2) Students retell the content of the application letter based on key vocabulary.<br>
          (Design intention: This activity provides the context of an application letter, allowing students to
          select appropriate words in a discourse context. Students need to identify the text type as an application
          letter and complete the content, which not only consolidates relevant vocabulary but also familiarizes
          them with the basic format of writing an application letter.)<br>
          <strong>Step 5: Homework</strong><br>
          Based on the content of this lesson, attempt to design a mind map about the basic structure of exclamatory
          sentences, the basic structure of an application letter, and the key vocabulary of this unit.

      <h3>Culture Understanding &Group Work</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          This lesson is part of the Group Work section in the textbook. This section guides students to learn about
          articles on the theme of animal protection, including a story about a loving animal shelter. It aims to help
          students understand the preciousness of life, respect life, learn about the work of volunteers in animal
          shelters, and inspire students' sense of public morality and social responsibility by creating posters to
          convey love and responsibility.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          In previous studies, students have already discussed the significance of volunteer work, such as the cultural
          heritage sense of volunteers in the Forbidden City mentioned in the reading section, and the social
          responsibility expressed in becoming more useful to society during International Volunteer Day. However, the
          attitude towards life and responsibility has not been deeply considered. This article can promote students'
          in-depth thinking about the value of life. However, students still have weak language skills in expressing
          values, requiring the teacher to provide scaffolding for support.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          1. Students will be able to understand the theme of the news article, learn about the basic work content of
          animal shelters, and the difficulties they face.<br>
          2. Students will be able to summarize the division of volunteer work needed in shelters and the necessary
          qualifications.<br>
          3. Students will be able to design a volunteer recruitment letter on behalf of a loving shelter.<br>
          4. Students will be able to reflect the values of caring for life and respecting life, along with a sense of
          social responsibility, in the recruitment letter.

        <h4>Teaching Procedure</h4>
        <p>
          <u>Before Class:</u><br>
          Conduct a survey about pet ownership among the students:<br>
          Do you keep pets?<br>
          How long have you kept them?<br>
          Have you/your family/your friend stopped keeping a pet? Why?<br>
          What do you know about “stray dogs/cats”?<br>
          (Design intention: Preparing relevant information before class helps students understand the significance of
          animal shelters and prepares them for the introductory activity in class.)<br>
          <u>During Class:</u><br>
          <strong>Step 1: Warming-up</strong><br>
          1. Discuss and Group Presentation<br>
          (1) Group discussion about household pets and fill in the table.<br>
          (2) Discuss the causes and attitudes towards stray cats and dogs in groups.<br>
          (3) Groups report their discussion results. During this process, the teacher encourages students to express
          their love
          for animals and appreciation for life.<br>
          Possible Version:<br>
          There are ______ classmates in our group who have kept pets. ______ of them/their friends consider pets as
          __________ (friends/family members/belongings/...). The possible reason for “stray animals” is
          ____________________ (e.g., Some people keep them just for fun./They do not love animals/ ...).<br>
          (Design intention: Through discussion, students gain a deeper understanding of the role of pets in real life,
          the
          causes and issues of stray animals, thereby better appreciating the significance of volunteer work and
          preparing
          emotionally for values of cherishing life and bearing social responsibility.)<br>
          <strong>Step 2: Practice</strong><br>
          Group Work<br>
          1. Process Group Work Activity 1:<br>
          Groups read and summarize the theme and main points of the article. The teacher guides students on reading
          strategies:<br>
          Predict the theme from pictures and titles.<br>
          Predict the main idea of paragraphs from subheadings.<br>
          Theme:<br>
          Animal shelter/an interview on animal shelter<br>
          Main Points:<br>
          Volunteer work at the shelter.<br>
          Animal adoption.<br>
          Volunteers feel impressive at the shelter.<br>
          Share the theme and main points.<br>
          2. Process Group Work Activity 2:<br>
          Groups collaborate to identify the division of work and necessary qualifications for the shelter. Present the
          findings in a class-shared table.<br>
          3. Process Group Work Activity 3:<br>
          Groups discuss the structure of a recruitment letter, with the teacher prompting students to refer to the
          structural
          elements of the Forbidden City recruitment on page 52:<br>
          Background information<br>
          Responsibilities of volunteers<br>
          Requirements for volunteers<br>
          Means of application<br>
          Organizer<br>
          The teacher guides students to discuss the significance of volunteer work and encourages them to reflect
          positive
          values in the recruitment letter.<br>
          4. Group Presentation and Sharing:<br>
          Each group presents their recruitment letter, the whole class reads the results, and votes for the most
          attractive
          recruitment letter. Tally the votes and have selected students share the voting results and reasons. The
          teacher
          provides language support for student votes, such as:<br>
          I am deeply attracted by group _______, because ___________.<br>
          The most impressive recruitment is from group _______, because _____.<br>
          I would like to be a volunteer at group ______’s shelter, because ______.<br>
          (Design intention: This activity requires students to apply the language knowledge learned in this unit to
          complete a
          realistic task in a specific context, deepening their understanding of the significance of volunteer work,
          value
          experience, and emotional experience.)<br>
          <strong>Step 3: Conclusion</strong><br>
          Self-assessment<br>
          1. Look at the vocabulary cloud and check your grasp of the words and phrases in this unit.<br>
          2. Based on what you have learned in this unit, fill in a table to evaluate your performance.<br>
          (Design intention: Using the vocabulary cloud, students can check their mastery of the words and phrases in
          this
          unit, identify shortcomings, strengthen independent learning awareness, and while
          conducting self-assessment, summary, and reflection, formulate learning plans based on their characteristics,
          fostering good study habits, and promoting sustainable development of language learning and learning
          ability.)<br>
          <strong>Step 4: Homework</strong><br>
          Groups complete the recruitment letter and upload it to a public platform, voting for the best work.
