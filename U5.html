        <div>
          <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            This lesson's content is taken from the “Fourteenth Five-Year Plan”
            vocational education national planning textbook published by the
            Higher Education Press, from Unit 5 of "English 2 Basic Module." The
            focus is on history and culture, and the section includes a Warming
            Up and Listening and Speaking activities centered around art. The
            lesson features listening activities involving extended dialogues
            about artists and their works, leading to spoken exercises
            discussing exhibits. Students are expected to understand information
            about ancient civilizations and to be able to ask for and provide
            information about various artists and artworks.

          <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            The students in this class are first-year vocational school students
            with some basic English skills, but there is a significant
            divergence in their abilities: some students are very interested and
            can communicate fluently in English, while others have low interest,
            are reluctant to speak, and feel intimidated. From previous
            learning, they have some understanding of ancient civilizations and
            a preliminary knowledge of the most representative ancient
            civilizations of different countries. On the topic of ancient
            civilizations, students can name some countries and generally
            identify categories of works, but they lack the language skills and
            knowledge to describe artists and artworks in English. Therefore,
            teachers should design educational activities that progress from
            easy to difficult, from simple to complex, from mechanical imitation
            to substitution exercises, and then to practical language use,
            gradually laying out steps to minimize potential difficulties and
            frustrations for students.

          <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
          <p>
            1. Students should be able to understand dialogues about ancient
            civilizations and extract key information.<br />
            2. Students should be able to exchange information about famous
            domestic and international artists and their renowned artworks.<br />
            3. Students should be able to appreciate the greatness of ancient
            civilizations and their profound impact on modern civilization
            during conversational exchanges.

          <p>
            Teaching Focus: Students should be able to discuss famous domestic
            and international artists and their renowned artworks.<br />
            Teaching Challenge: Students should be able to proficiently use
            vocabulary and sentence structures to describe artists and artworks,
            such as:<br />

            artist, works, impress, originator, sculptor, influence, portrait,
            curious, vitality, attractive, enlighten, indeed<br />
            What artist or works impress you most in the exhibition?<br />
            I think I am most attracted to…<br />
            He is thought to be one of the greatest artists and sculptors of the
            20th century.<br />
            I think even today we are influenced by his ideas.<br />
            Which work is your favorite?

        <h3>Reading and Writing</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            This lesson's content is drawn from Unit 5's Reading and Writing
            section of the textbook, focusing on an article about the Silk Road.
            The text is structured in a "general-specific-general" format,
            beginning with an introduction to the concept of the "Silk Road,"
            then detailing the origins, routes, and key figures of the maritime
            Silk Road, followed by the land routes and their historical roles,
            and concluding with a summary of the Silk Road's historical value.
            The article provides a thorough introduction to the history of the
            Silk Road and its contributions to human civilization from various
            perspectives. The text features distinctive stylistic traits and
            vivid language, integrating educational elements with political
            thought. By reading the article, students become familiar with and
            master the stylistic and linguistic features of humanities
            exposition; they use reading strategies like keyword analysis and
            employ explanation techniques such as examples, deduction, and
            induction to develop skills in summarizing the main theme and the
            central ideas of each paragraph. Through observation, analysis, and
            comparison, students recognize the expressive traits of humanities
            expository texts and, by combining the Silk Road's routes, origins,
            trade goods, and associated figures, gain an appreciation for
            ancient China's splendid history and its significant contributions
            to world civilization, strengthening their cultural confidence and
            actively promoting and spreading Chinese civilization.

        <div>
          <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            After the previous two lessons, students have become familiar with
            the topic of ancient civilizations, able to exchange information
            about famous domestic and international artists and their works, and
            from these discussions, appreciate the greatness of ancient
            civilizations and their profound impacts on modern civilization. The
            previous lesson's homework on "Introducing Fine Cultural Relics of
            the Silk Road" also gave students a deeper background understanding
            of the Silk Road topic. While students have grasped some sentences
            about ancient civilizations and have a basic understanding of the
            structure of expository texts, they still lack the language needed
            to write expositions about ancient civilizations and need a deeper
            understanding of the Silk Road's role and greatness through the
            study and analysis of historical facts.

        <div>
          <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
          <p>
            1. Students should be able to understand articles about the Silk
            Road, use keywords to grasp the text's content, and employ various
            explanatory methods like examples, deduction, and induction to
            summarize the article's theme and identify details within each
            paragraph.<br />
            2. Through observation, analysis, and comparison, students should
            become familiar with and master the structure and linguistic
            features of humanities expository texts, express their views on the
            topic of the Silk Road, and write short introductory essays about
            the topic.<br />
            By considering the Silk Road's routes, origins, traded goods, and
            associated figures, students should appreciate the glorious history
            of ancient China and its outstanding contributions to world
            civilization, strengthen their national cultural confidence, and
            actively promote and spread Chinese civilization.

            Teaching Focus: Students should be able to understand articles about
            the Silk Road and, through observation, analysis, and comparison,
            become familiar with and master the structure and linguistic
            features of humanities expository texts, express their views on the
            Silk Road, and write short essays on the topic.<br />
            Teaching Challenge: In the process of writing essays on the Silk
            Road, students should be able to correctly use related structures
            and language, such as: link, actual, route, maritime, peak,
            emissary, boost, western, exchange, as early as, search for, China
            fever.<br />
            Examples of challenging content include:<br />

            Did you know that the Silk Road was neither an actual road nor a
            single route?<br />
            During the Eastern Han Dynasty, the Chinese emissary Gan Ying was
            sent to search for "Da Qin," the Chinese name for the Roman Empire
            at that time.

        <h3>Language Practice & Vocabulary</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            This lesson's content is selected from Unit 5's Language Practice
            section of the textbook, divided into Grammar and Vocabulary parts.
            The material revolves around the theme of ancient civilizations,
            focusing on the basic usage of object clauses and key vocabulary
            related to ancient civilizations. Object clauses are a major
            grammatical topic. Students will summarize the basic usage of object
            clauses through activities such as observing example sentences,
            identifying markings, completing sentences, and engaging in
            dialogues. This will help them perceive differences in thinking
            between Western and Eastern cultures and apply this understanding to
            enhance their practical language skills. By using phrases and words
            in specific contexts, students consolidate the language points of
            this unit and achieve real-life application.

          <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            After middle school, students have some understanding of object
            clauses, but their grasp of related knowledge is not solid, and
            their understanding is not deep enough. They still need systematic
            and effective learning and practice to master the basic usage of
            object clauses. Through the first four lessons of this unit,
            students have accumulated some vocabulary related to ancient
            civilizations but still need to continually apply this knowledge to
            solidify their language skills.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
          <p>
            1. Students should master the basic usage of object clauses and be
            able to use them accurately.<br />
            2. Students should be able to accurately use key vocabulary related
            to ancient civilizations in specific contexts, such as: boost, link,
            actual, treasure, exchange, as early as, date back to, attract to,
            search for, etc.<br />
            3. Through the study and practical application of grammatical
            knowledge, students experience English learning methods and develop
            good study habits.<br />
            By studying object clauses, students understand the differences in
            thought expressed in language between Western and Eastern cultures.

        <h3>Culture Understanding &Group Work</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Text Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            This lesson integrates the "Culture Understanding" and "Group Work"
            sections from Unit 5 of the textbook. The "Culture Understanding"
            section is an expository text that introduces Marco Polo and his
            travelogues. The article has a clear structure: it begins with an
            overall introduction to Marco Polo and his "Travels of Marco Polo,"
            then details his experiences in China, and finally discusses the
            positive impact of "The Travels of Marco Polo" on enhancing
            understanding and communication between the East and the West. By
            reading the text, students expand their knowledge, learn the stories
            behind "The Travels of Marco Polo," appreciate the legendary tales
            of ancient East-West exchanges, and recognize Marco Polo's
            contributions to improving East-West interactions. The "Group Work"
            section creates a real task to test students' learning outcomes.
            Students deepen their understanding of ancient Chinese civilization
            and cultural treasures through tasks such as learning basic
            information about the Mogao Caves, searching online for relevant
            information, creating slideshows about the Mogao Caves, and
            presenting them, all while developing teamwork and innovative
            skills.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Student Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            Through previous learning, students have become familiar with and
            mastered the stylistic features and language characteristics of
            humanities expository texts, accumulating a significant number of
            phrases describing ancient civilizations and becoming more
            proficient in using object clauses. Additionally, students have
            developed some capability in collecting, organizing, and
            synthesizing information, and have gained a deeper appreciation and
            understanding of the profound impacts of ancient Eastern and Western
            civilizations on global culture. Students generally enjoy completing
            learning tasks in groups and have some teamwork skills. However,
            their ability to analyze, prepare for, and complete tasks still
            needs to be further enhanced through continuous practice.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Instructional Objectives</h4>
          <p>
            1. Students should be able to accurately grasp the main idea of the
            article, express personal opinions on its content, and appreciate
            Marco Polo's contributions to enhancing East-West exchanges and
            understanding.<br />
            2. Students should be able to collect and integrate information
            based on prompts, using the correct structure and language to
            introduce the Mogao Caves, thereby deepening their understanding of
            ancient Chinese civilization and cultural treasures while
            cultivating teamwork and innovative skills.<br />
            3. Students should be able to perform self-evaluations, summarize and
            reflect on learning methods and strategies, develop good learning
            habits, and enhance their language learning and application skills.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Key and Difficult Points</h4>
          <p>
            Teaching Focus: Students should be able to collect and synthesize
            information, use the correct structure and language to introduce the
            Mogao Caves, and complete learning tasks.<br />
